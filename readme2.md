       Connection Between Wildfires and Logging Activity in California
Question: Does logging activity affect wildfire occurrences? 
Hypothesis: In areas with higher logging activity, the acres burned from wildfires will increase.

Description / Background:
Wildfires are a natural and essential part of many Californian ecosystems, playing a key role in maintaining balance by supporting new growth and recycling nutrients. However, their continuous impact on human infrastructure, communities, and threats to the ecosystem can be devastating. For our project, we want to explore the connections between wildfires and logging within California’s national forests. 
Specifically, California has been known to have the most wildfires in terms of the number of wildfires and acres burned. As we are impacted directly, these fires are devastating for many residents living near wildfire events, and due to the recent events of the Los Angeles fires, researching the potential factors causing these events is essential for proposing solutions. By investigating the logging activities within the national forests, we should be able to see the relationship between the wildfires and the amount of trees in those areas. 
California wildfires are due to the significant climate change factors of warmer temperatures and reduced precipitation. With less precipitation, vegetation within the national forests will become dry, increasing the possibility of potential ignition. From 2020 to 2023, the annual average number of acres burned was about three times higher than in 2010 (OEHHA 2024). Although wildfires are a natural occurrence and will continue to be part of California’s landscape, logging practices have proceeded to remove most fire-resistant trees for timber, leaving young shrubs and saplings that are more susceptible to ignition, to fight for themselves (CALWILD 2025). Logging also increases fire risk by assembling treetops, needles, leaves, branches/limbs, and other parts of trees that are not collected, on the ground escalating the potential fuel available for the next wildfire (‘Salvage Logging - Sierra Forest Legacy’ 2025, para. 2). Observing and understanding how logging activities influence wildfire spread can help mitigate fire risks while balancing economic and environmental priorities.
